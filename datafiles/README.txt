Lost in the desolate society within George Orwells "1984", you must attempt to survive as long as possible, or take the easy way out.


==INSTRUCTIONS==

Follow the schedule of wakeup, eat, work, eat, sleep. 

There are two counters to keep up with. Your sanity and a hidden counter for your reputation with the party.

Your sanity can be kept up several ways. Eating, succeeding at work, and doing something new.

Your reputation goes down with the work of hazardous tasks like writing in your journal and failing at work. Your reputation can be lightly brought up by each properly succeeded task within your work.


If your sanity dips below a certain treshold, you may find your reputation be dipping from your unfriendly mood.

If your reputation dips below a certain treshold, you have a high chance to be vaporized in the middle of the night.
